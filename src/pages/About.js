                    <h1>GCES IT EXPO 2018</h1>
                    <p>

                        Information and Communication Technologies and newer and emerging tools of IT industry,
                        Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) and how they can fit in our society and how can we benefit from
                        IT in organizations, government offices, educational institutions and our day to day life. It
                        will address many more challenges that our society has been facing without IT.

                    <p>
                        ICT presents itself as an effective and affordable solution to overcome the socio-economic
                        imbalance due to the geographical remoteness of Nepal. But due to lack of awareness, these
                        technologies are not exploited. GCES promotes ICT by showcasing the latest hardware and software
                        products, Free Software Projects, and other related Technologies.
